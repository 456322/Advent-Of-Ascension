If you were to describe what happens when you combine a Furby with a slime before jamming it full of leaves and throwing it on its head, you'd give Bush Babies at a shining example.
These deceptively short creatures appear as though they would hang around high-density jungles and trees, preferring to use their appearance to blend into nearby leaves and shrubs.
Despite this however, they have only ever been seen around Leafy Giants specifically, but it is unsure whether this is coincidental or if there is some kind of relationship involved.

Despite their short stature, they are incredibly fast on their feet, and love using this to their advantage to be a general nuisance to who-ever they feel like.
Avoid them entirely until you are ready to defend yourself from a pack of these impish nightmares.
