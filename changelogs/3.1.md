(+: Added; -: Removed; *: Modified)

Commands:
+ Added the /aoaevent command. Enable or disable events, or just check which ones are active (Github suggestion #259)
+ Added the /aoaskill command. Check, modify, or just mess around with levels and xp 
* Fixed the /aoastructure command giving feedback to all ops on a server (Github issue #466)
* Added /aoastructures command alias

Advancements:
+ Added the first 200+ advancements to AoA to start! I plan on adding many more as we go into the future, this is just the beginning (With ancient rock background, Github suggestion #239). I'll also be adding rewards and such to advancements after the loot update
+ Added custom triggers for level up and xp gain for data pack makers.

Leaderboards:
+ Added nearly all the backend code required to have leaderboards implemented into AoA. They run on a separate thread to the game, so they will take advantage of servers/computers with multiple processing cores. I haven't yet activated them because it's a rather complex system in the background and I want to do some more testing and keep an eye on how it runs in the community before I make it public.
  Will keep track of a configurable number of top-ranked players by level in each skill, as well as a total skill level
  Can be disabled by server owners if it's impacting performance too much or there are other issues.
  Will only run on servers, not in single player

Interfaces:
- The skills gui is now GONE. Yes. Gone.
+ Added a new gui. This gui contains all your skills, resources, tribute, and more in a much more informative, and prettier package. It even comes pre-packaged with a few themes to start. You might notice some of the tabs are disabled. They are coming soon!

Skills:
- Removed Vulcanism
* Modified creation points by a factor of 30. All values are now 30x smaller, which allows me to keep the values consistent, easy to read, and easy to use. This won't affect regen time or usage
* Modified soul points by a factor of 100. All values are now 100x smaller, which allows me to keep the values consistent, easy to read, and easy to use. This won't affect regen time or usage

Configurations:
* Moved configuration files to an aoa subdirectory
