# Blocks
* Fixed Carved Rune of Power not behaving naturally when interacted with [#3342](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3342 "Github issue #3342")
* Added some initial functionality to the Boss Altar. It can be tested with the giants (though they'd not coded to be compatible with it, realistically) by using one of their blocks on the altar (leaves, ice, etc)

# Entities
* Did more fixes for mobs not spawning
* Fixed Gemtrap crashing the game when hit [#3338](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3338 "Github issue #3338")
* Fixed Leafy Giant's shield going invisible through restarts [#3326](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3326 "Github issue #3326")

# Items
* Adjusted Goofy Greatblade's damage calculation to be more accurate [#3336](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3336 "Github issue #3336")
* Did more fixes for Lunar & Millennium Greatblades not calculating damage properly [#3335](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3335 "Github issue #3335")
* Changed Torn Page to Torn Pages

# Models/Textures
* Fixed Trickster not having animations or half it's hat

# Other
* Fixed some random crashes that rarely occur at startup [#3341](https://github.com/Tslat/Advent-Of-Ascension/issues/3341 "Github issue #3341")
* Increased the chance of Carved Runes being generated with Ruined Teleporter Frames
* Moved Patchouli Books to resourcepacks instead of pure datapacks per their new system. This allows for customisation of content via client-side localisation
* Added Patchouli entries for Lessons, Discovery, and The Portal
* Modified the Overworld dungeon loot chests table slightly
