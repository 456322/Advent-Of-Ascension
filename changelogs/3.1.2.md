Misc:
* Fixed issue causing weird lighting issues when mobs with special properties are nearby

* Mobs will no longer spawn on 'smooth' stone variants (andesite smooth, etc)
* The jar file is now signed
* The mod will now require a minimum of Forge 14.23.5.2768. There's no functional reason for this - I'm just really tired of people using old versions for quite literally no reason

Halos:
+ Added halos. These are special floaty-things that sit nicely above your head and give off a pretty glow. They are reserved for people of stature within AoA.
